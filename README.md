# Running "Product Finder"
	Cd to directory with "gui.py" and "chromedriver.exe"
  Run the following command
	
	```
  python gui.py
	```
  A GUI should pop up. Enter the URL with https(will not work otherwise) and type in a key search.
  Once finished, the chrome window will close and a CSV file will be generated with the name used for the search
# Issues
